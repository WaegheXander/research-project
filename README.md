## Getting started

### Clone the project

Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WaegheXander/research-project.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```cd
cd research-project/
```

### Project Structure

```

## Project setup

### Requirements

Ensure the following prerequisites are installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Internet ðŸ™‚

### Server Deploy

__*note:*__

> An agent is already present on the server, so you don't need to create an additional agent on the same machine.

To deploy the server u need to change your directory to `Code/Server/`

```bash
cd Code/Server/
```

Before your start the server u need to change the `.env` variable. Currently the file is named `.env_example`

1 __Change the file__ `.env_example` __to__ `.env`

```bash
# Windows
move .env_example .env

# Linux
mv .env_example .env
```

2 __Replace the__ `.env` __variable to what u want them to be__

```bash
MYSQL_DATABASE=# DB_NAME
MYSQL_USER=# DB_USERNAME
MYSQL_PASSWORD=# DB_PASSWORD
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=# DB ROOT PASSWORD
```

Save the file & exit. Now u can start the server by running this command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> if u don't want it to be running in the background remove the -d. EX: If u want to debug

To stop the server without losing any data, run this command:

``` bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the server an remove all stored data, run this command

``` bash
docker-compose down -v
```

U can use the `docker ps` command to see is the containers are running.

It should be something like this

```plaintext
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                             COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                 PORTS                                            NAMES
e412cdbbe03b   zabbix/zabbix-web-nginx-mysql:alpine-6.4-latest   "docker-entrypoint.sh"   45 hours ago   Up 8 hours             8443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp                   zabbix-web-nginx-mysql
6e1d677632ae   zabbix/zabbix-server-mysql:alpine-6.4-latest      "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   45 hours ago   Up 8 hours             0.0.0.0:162->162/udp, 0.0.0.0:10051->10051/tcp   zabbix-server
c47c17744a12   zabbix/zabbix-java-gateway:alpine-6.4-latest      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   45 hours ago   Up 8 hours             0.0.0.0:10052->10052/tcp                         zabbix-java-gateway
6992e343fcaa   zabbix/zabbix-agent:alpine-6.4-latest             "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   45 hours ago   Up 8 hours             10050/tcp                                        zabbix-agent
f8304e6c02e3   mysql:8.0                                         "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   45 hours ago   Up 8 hours (healthy)   3306/tcp, 33060/tcp                              mysql-server
```

To see if everything works go to any webbrowser and type the url: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

### [Optional]

1 __Using an other port for the web interface__

if u're server port 80 is already in use u can simply modify the port in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the server `zabbix-web-nginx-mysql`

```dockerfile
# code ...
  - ZBX_SERVER_HOST=zabbix-server
  - DB_SERVER_HOST=mysql-server
networks:
  - zabbix-net
ports:
  - "80:8080" # change port 80 to whatever port is available
restart: always
depends_on:
  - mysql-server
# code ...
```

Don't forget when u now want to see the web interface u need to give the port in the url
`http://localhost:<port>/`

2 __Using an other port for snmp traps__

I u would like to use an other port for the snmp traps change the port at the service `zabbix-server`

```dockerfile
# code ...
networks:
      - zabbix-net
    ports:
      - "10051:10051"
      - "162:162/udp" # change the first port 162 to whatever u like 
    expose:
      - 10051
    restart: always
    depends_on:
# code ...
```

#### Finally

After u did this u need to restart the docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

#### Credentials

To default credentials are

> Username: Admin\
Password: zabbix

## Agent Deploy

There are 2 option to deploy an agent [Quickdeploy](#quickdeploy) & [Manual](#manual)

### Quickdeploy

For the quick deploy u need to change your directory to `quickdeploy/`.
In this directory u will find 2 scripts

If u are on windows run the `agent.ps1` script

```bash
./agent.ps1
```

If u are on a linux system run the `agent.sh` script:

```bash
./agent.sh
# or
sh agent.sh
```

Just fill in the parameter u get asked and the script does the rest.

U can use the `docker ps` command to see is the agents is running.

### Manual

To deploy the agent u need to change your directory to `Code/Agent/`

```bash
cd Code/Agent/
```

Before your start the aggent u need to change the `.env` variable. Currently the file is named `.env_example`

1 __Change the file to__ `.env`

```bash
# Windows
move .env_example .env

# Linux
mv .env_example .env
```

2 __Replace the__ `.env` __variable to what u want them to be__

```bash
SERVER_IP= # The ip of your zabbix server
```

Save the file & exit. Now u can start the server by running this command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> If u don't want it to be running in the background remove the -d. EX: If u want to debug

To stop the server without losing any data just run this command:

``` bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the server an remove all stored data, run this command

``` bash
docker-compose down -v
```

U can use the `docker ps` command to see is the containers are running.

It should be something like this

```plaintext
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                           NAMES
24bf9a562c15   zabbix/zabbix-agent:alpine-6.4-latest   "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   7 hours ago   Up 45 minutes   0.0.0.0:10050->10050/tcp, :::10050->10050/tcp   myraspberrypi
```
